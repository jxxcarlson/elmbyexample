Physics101
==========

Physics101 is a physics simulation package.  There there are two parts:
the library and the demos.

  * Parabola: a demo of throwing a ball into the air and letting it fall
    under the influence of gravity.  Uses screen coordinates.

  * Parabola2: the same, but uses Cartesian coordinates.


*To run the Parabola app:* Use `elm make src/physics101/Parabola.elm` from the root
of the `elmbyexample` folder, the open `index.html`
using a browser.
