# ScoreApp

The three apps presented here, `scoreApp1`, `scoreApp2`, and `scoreApp3`
are based on the counter app in the [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/buttons.html). The first is a variant of the app in the Guide. The second add some styling using the `elm/html` package. The third adds the styling using `mdgriffith/elm-ui`.
